Many Core Code Kata about Shared Memory
=======================================

Second of a series of Code Kata accompanying sessions on currency on many core.

The objective of this Code Kata is to broaden and deepen knowledge of
concurrency techniques. There are many ways to fail, some to succeed and
several good solutions in a few distinctively different styles.
 
1. Read the  [`code`](src/main/java/name/robertburrelldonkin/kata/manycore/memoryshare/ASharedMemoryKata.java) 
 (in `name.robertburrelldonkin.kata.manycore.memoryshare`). 
 What do you expect to happen when you run the application...?
 
2. Run the application. Offer an explanation for what you observe.

3. There are many ways that the counter might be refactored to make the behaviour more reasonable 
   and consistent with the single thread case. 
   
    1. Outline three different approaches

    2. For each approach, describe one advantage and one disadvantage

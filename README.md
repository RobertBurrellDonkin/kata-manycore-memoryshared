Code Kata on Shared Memory
=======================================

Second of a series of Code Kata accompanying sessions on concurrency on many cores.

The objective of this Code Kata is to broaden and deepen knowledge of
concurrency techniques. There are many ways to fail, some to succeed and
several good solutions in a few distinctively different styles.
 
1. Read the  [`code`](src/main/java/name/robertburrelldonkin/kata/manycore/memoryshare/ASharedMemoryKata.java). 
 What do you expect to happen when the application is run...?
 
2. Run the application. Offer an explanation for what you observe.

3. There are many ways to refactor the counter, aiming for consistent behaviour 
   whether with many threads or just one.   
   
    1. Outline three different approaches

    2. For each approach, describe one advantage and one disadvantage
